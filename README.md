# BoostedGG 

BoostedGG is a Google Chrome extension for [op.gg](https://op.gg) that removes the most annoying pop-ups that render the site unusable for daily leaderboard look-ups.

- Adds Quality of Life features such as enlarging the most important stats and increasing clarity on user profiles.

First and foremost I made it for myself because alternatives to op.gg, such as [DEEPLOL](https://deeplol.gg) suck, but anyone is free to use it. See how to do so [here.](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked)
